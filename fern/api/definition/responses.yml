        Unique ID for the form. Find in your form URL. For example, in the URL
        "https://mysite.typeform.com/to/u6nXL7" the form_id is `u6nXL7`.

        query-parameters:
          page_size:
            docs: >-
              Maximum number of responses. Default value is **25**. Maximum
              value is **1000**. If your typeform has fewer than 1000 responses,
              you can retrieve all of the responses in a single request by
              adding the `page_size` parameter. If your typeform has more than
              1000 responses, use the [`since` and
              `until`](responses/walkthroughs#use-the-since-and-until-query-parameters-to-retrieve-a-date-range)
              or
              [`after`](responses/walkthroughs#use-the-after-query-parameter-to-paginate)
              query parameters to narrow the scope of your request.
            type: optional<integer>
          since:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to responses submitted since the specified date and
              time. In ISO 8601 format, UTC time, to the second, with T as a
              delimiter between the date and time. See the [Responses
              Walkthroughs](/responses/walkthroughs/#use-query-parameters-to-retrieve-specific-data)
              for an example request that uses the `since` parameter.
            type: optional<string>
          until:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to responses submitted until the specified date and
              time. In ISO 8601 format, UTC time, to the second, with T as a
              delimiter between the date and time. See the [Responses
              Walkthroughs](/responses/walkthroughs/#use-query-parameters-to-retrieve-specific-data)
              for an example request that uses the `until` parameter.
            type: optional<string>
          after:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to responses submitted after the specified token. If
              you use the `after` parameter, the responses will be sorted in the
              order that our system processed them (instead of the default
              order, `submitted_at`). This ensures that you can traverse the
              complete set of responses without repeating entries. See the
              [Responses
              Walkthroughs](/responses/walkthroughs/#use-query-parameters-to-retrieve-specific-data)
              for an example request that uses the `after` parameter.
            type: optional<string>
          before:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to responses submitted before the specified token.
              If you use the `before` parameter, the responses will be sorted in
              the order that our system processed them (instead of the default
              order, `submitted_at`). This ensures that you can traverse the
              complete set of responses without repeating entries.
            type: optional<string>
          included_response_ids:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to the specified `response_id` values. Use a
              comma-separated list to specify more than one `response_id` value.
            type: optional<string>

            type: optional<boolean>
          sort:
            docs: >-
              Order of responses. Currently, responses are automatically sorted
              by `submitted_at,desc`---the date they were submitted, from newest
              to oldest. We plan to add more options for sort order soon.
            type: optional<string>
          query:
            docs: >-
              Limit request to only responses that that include the specified
              string. You can specify any string as the `query` value. The
              string will be escaped, and the query will include Hidden Fields.

    delete:
      path: ""
      method: DELETE
      docs: >-
        Delete responses to a form. You must specify the `included_tokens`
        parameter.
      display-name: Delete responses
      request:
        name: DeleteReponseRequest
        query-parameters:
          included_tokens:
            docs: >-
              Comma-separated list of tokens of the responses to delete. You can
              list up to **1000** tokens.
